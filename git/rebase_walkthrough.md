# Real Git Rebase Walkthrough - The Dockerfile Conflict Resolution

## What Actually Happened: Step-by-Step Analysis

This is a real walkthrough of successfully rebasing a feature branch (`dl/heroku-to-ecs-migration`) onto the latest master while preserving custom Dockerfile changes.

### The Initial Problem

**Branch state:** Feature branch with 30 commits containing Dockerfile modifications
**Goal:** Get latest master changes without losing custom Dockerfile work
**Challenge:** Both master and feature branch had conflicting Dockerfile changes

### The Commands That Worked

```bash
# 1958: Download latest remote state (safe operation)
git fetch origin

# 1959: Start rebase - hit conflicts immediately
git rebase origin/master
# Result: "CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in Dockerfile"

# 1960: Check what's happening
git status
# Shows: interactive rebase in progress, 1/30 commits, Dockerfile conflict

# 1961: Keep OUR version of Dockerfile (from feature branch)
git checkout --ours Dockerfile

# 1962: Mark conflict as resolved
git add Dockerfile

# 1963: Continue to next commit in rebase
git rebase --continue
# Result: Hit ANOTHER Dockerfile conflict on commit 2/30

# 1964: Abort this painful approach
git rebase --abort

# 1965: Retry with automatic conflict resolution strategy
git rebase origin/master -X ours
# Result: SUCCESS! Automatic resolution kept our Dockerfile for all conflicts
```

### What the `-X ours` Strategy Did

The `-X ours` flag told git:

- **When conflicts occur:** Automatically favor the version from YOUR branch
- **For duplicate commits:** Drop commits that are "already upstream" (cleaning up your history)
- **Result:** Clean rebase with your Dockerfile preserved

**Key insight:** This avoided manually resolving 30+ potential Dockerfile conflicts by setting a blanket strategy.

### The Success Indicators

```bash
# These messages showed it worked:
dropping f18a80583190ffc8f5dcf9a6b08058d5e372c887 use secrets -- patch contents already upstream
dropping e62a218e59ebe56626303509fec7f6ae390095fe add yarn install properly -- patch contents already upstream
# ... (many more "dropping" messages)
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/dl/heroku-to-ecs-migration.
```

**Translation:** Git automatically cleaned up duplicate work and successfully applied your unique changes on top of master.

### The Final State

```bash
# 1967: Verify recent commits look correct
git log --oneline -10

# 1968: Confirm Dockerfile still has your changes
git diff HEAD~1 Dockerfile

# 1969: Push the rebased branch
git push --force-with-lease
# Result: + d0d205515b6...220ba57047f dl/heroku-to-ecs-migration -> dl/heroku-to-ecs-migration (forced update)
```

## Recovery Options: "How Do I Undo This?"

If you realized something went wrong, you have multiple safety nets:

### Option 1: Return to Pre-Rebase State (Safest)

```bash
# The old commit hash is visible in the push output: d0d205515b6
git reset --hard d0d205515b6
git push --force-with-lease

# This takes you back to exactly where you were before any rebase attempts
```

### Option 2: Use Git Reflog (Ultimate Safety Net)

```bash
# See every state your branch has been in
git reflog

# Output will show something like:
# 220ba57 HEAD@{0}: rebase finished: returning to refs/heads/dl/heroku-to-ecs-migration
# d0d2055 HEAD@{1}: rebase (start): checkout origin/master
# d0d2055 HEAD@{2}: checkout: moving from master to dl/heroku-to-ecs-migration

# Go back to any previous state
git reset --hard HEAD@{2}  # Back to before rebase started
```

### Option 3: Selective Recovery

If some parts are good but you want to fix specific files:

```bash
# Reset just the Dockerfile to a previous version
git checkout d0d205515b6 -- Dockerfile
git add Dockerfile
git commit -m "Restore previous Dockerfile version"
```

## Why This Approach Was Correct

### Alternative Approaches We Could Have Used

**Merge instead of rebase:**

```bash
git merge origin/master
# Pros: Only one conflict resolution session
# Cons: Creates merge commit, messier history
```

**Manual conflict resolution:**

```bash
git rebase origin/master
# Then manually resolve each of the 30 conflicts
# Pros: Full control over each conflict
# Cons: Extremely time-consuming for repetitive conflicts
```

### Why `-X ours` Was Perfect Here

1. **Repetitive conflicts:** Same file (Dockerfile) conflicting across many commits
2. **Clear preference:** You definitely wanted YOUR Dockerfile version
3. **Automatic cleanup:** Git removed duplicate commits for you
4. **Clean history:** Linear commit history without merge commits

## Lessons Learned

### When to Use `-X ours` Strategy

**Good for:**

- Conflicts in configuration files you control (Dockerfile, nginx.conf, etc.)
- When you know you want to keep your version across multiple commits
- Feature branches with many small iterative commits

**Bad for:**

- Code files where you need both sets of changes
- When conflicts require careful human judgment
- Shared files that need both teams' contributions

### Warning Signs to Watch For

**During rebase, be concerned if you see:**

```bash
# TOO MANY files being dropped
dropping 50+ commits -- patch contents already upstream

# Important files being auto-resolved incorrectly
# (Check with git diff after rebase)
```

**After rebase, verify:**

```bash
# Your important changes are still there
git diff origin/master

# The commit count makes sense
git log --oneline | wc -l

# Your application still works
# (Run tests, start server, etc.)
```

## The "Never Lose Work" Checklist

Before any destructive Git operation:

### 1. Create a Backup Branch

```bash
git branch backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
# Creates: backup-20250603
```

### 2. Note Your Current Commit

```bash
git rev-parse HEAD
# Copy this hash somewhere safe
```

### 3. Check What You're About to Lose

```bash
git log --oneline HEAD..origin/master  # What you'll gain
git log --oneline origin/master..HEAD  # What might be at risk
```

### 4. Have an Escape Plan

```bash
# Know these commands before you start:
git rebase --abort          # Escape mid-rebase
git reset --hard COMMIT     # Go back to specific commit
git reflog                   # See all previous states
```

## VS Code/Cursor Version of This Workflow

### Initial Setup

1. **Source Control panel** shows branch status: `dl/heroku-to-ecs-migration ↑30 ↓127`
2. **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) → "Git: Fetch"

### Rebase Attempt 1 (Manual Resolution)

1. **Command Palette** → "Git: Rebase Branch" → Select "origin/master"
2. **Conflict appears:** Dockerfile shows in Source Control with "C" icon
3. **Open Dockerfile:** Shows conflict markers with blue/green sections
4. **Click "Accept Current Change"** (keep your version)
5. **Stage file:** Click "+" next to Dockerfile
6. **Continue:** Command Palette → "Git: Continue Rebase"
7. **Another conflict appears:** Same process needed for 29 more commits
8. **Abort:** Command Palette → "Git: Abort Rebase"

### Rebase Attempt 2 (Automatic Strategy)

Unfortunately, VS Code doesn't have a GUI way to specify `-X ours`. You need terminal:

1. **Open integrated terminal** (`` Ctrl+` ``)
2. **Run:** `git rebase origin/master -X ours`
3. **Success:** Source Control shows clean state
4. **Push:** Command Palette → "Git: Push (Force with Lease)"

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "I Don't See My Changes Anymore"

**Check if they were genuinely lost or just moved:**

```bash
# Search for your specific changes
git log --grep="dockerfile" --oneline
git log -p --grep="ECS"

# Check if file contents are what you expect
cat Dockerfile
```

### "Too Many Commits Were Dropped"

**This might be normal if:**

- You had many small iterative commits
- Master already incorporated similar changes
- Your commits were experimental/WIP

**Verify by checking:**

```bash
# Do you have the functionality you need?
git diff origin/master --name-only

# Are your key files present with your changes?
git show HEAD:Dockerfile
```

### "The Rebase Seems Stuck"

**If rebase hangs or shows weird output:**

```bash
# Safe abort and try again
git rebase --abort
git status  # Should show clean working tree
git fetch origin  # Get latest state
git rebase origin/master -X ours  # Try again
```

## Quick Reference: Recovery Commands

| Situation                       | Command                                | Effect                   |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Just rebased, want to undo      | `git reset --hard d0d205515b6`         | Back to pre-rebase state |
| Rebase in progress, want out    | `git rebase --abort`                   | Cancel current rebase    |
| Need to see all previous states | `git reflog`                           | Show complete history    |
| Want to check what changed      | `git diff d0d205515b6..HEAD`           | Compare before/after     |
| Selective file recovery         | `git checkout d0d205515b6 -- filename` | Restore just one file    |

## The Bottom Line

**What you accomplished:**

- ✅ Got all latest master changes in your branch
- ✅ Kept your custom Dockerfile exactly as you wanted
- ✅ Cleaned up duplicate/redundant commits automatically
- ✅ Maintained a clean, linear commit history
- ✅ Can now merge back to master cleanly when ready

**The key insight:** Sometimes the "nuclear option" (`-X ours`) is actually the cleanest solution when you have clear ownership of certain files and many repetitive conflicts.

Your approach was correct, efficient, and professional. The discomfort you felt is normal - rebasing with conflicts always feels scary, but you had good safety nets and made the right choices.
